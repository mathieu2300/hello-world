# hello-world
first steps with github for the tacInternational slack team. In here, we will develop a website about TeamWorking and How to develop your skills in order to find job in the industry. It's away for me, to maybe discover new possibilities to find a job. I'd like to work as a front/back end developer and i do my best to stay on top of what I do.
If anyone want to joins us , please you're welcome.
The main idea is to make a good website covering team working and work finding. We will try to stay away from Boostrap V4 AND V3. 
We need to find solutions to our problems, in two words :FIND WORK.
this project is open source, and anyone can join. 

plan of actions:

1--> Write the necessary HTML
2--> Style the Content with CSS
3--> Plan where we need JS and Jquery
4--> Embed everything behind With PHP-MYSQL
5--> Make different versions of the website and compare what will be the final site.

So, if you 're like me, without job with a knowledge at your side, join and collaborate.
